Hi there, Iâ€™m Marija

I'm currently finishing Front-end developer courses learning React and Node.js,  and hoping to find internship and swicth my carrier one day to Web Deveoplment. 
I'm confident using HTMl, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and somewhat less confident using MySQL and Javascript.
I have also used CorelDraw and Adobe Photoshop a lot in my earlier carrier as a Marketer. 

And I'd love to participate in any project to get more experience working on something that might actually go life.
If you could use my skills in your project, or maybe just have one in mind, please drop me and email at marija@dailyart.eu
